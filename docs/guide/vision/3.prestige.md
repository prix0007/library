To build a complete CyberSpace, one of the most crucial building blocks we would need is an Open Metaverse OS. Calling out early sometimes is also calling out wrong. However, in this case, an Open Metaverse OS is kinda inevitable. Outlier Ventures defines a very descriptive [paper](https://outlierventures.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/OV-Metaverse-OS_V6.pdf) on Open Metaverse OS from 2021. This stage is highly influenced by the paper specially cause a lot of aspects falls directly under our own larger vision of Cyberspace.

Here's some of the impressive parts of the paper:

> The Open Metaverse OS is best understood as an evolving collection of highly composable technologies that will increasingly, but selectively, be used to make aspects of an Open Metaverse possible as it seeks to serve a greater global population across several use cases and environments.

> This way of thinking about the Open Metaverse OS also allows a framework through which to
assess the openness or, otherwise, design choices and trade-offs made by a given instance of the
Metaverse including; is the code open source, are the assets portabile, is the data platform
proprietary or user controlled, who can create value, and the degree of UGC versus platform made
and how can it be monetized

_However way we look at it, it's pretty much spot on. Clearly a thorough research was done. This can act as a good starting point. However, for our case, this has to be further extended beyond._

Web3 today is largely still built on top of Web2. The Web3 infrastructure is largely lacking on it. We need a completely decentralised internet, A New Internet. More about it can be found [here](https://blog.anirudha.dev/building-a-new-world). A peer-to-peer internet, which is only dependent on each other. There won't be any need of servers at all. All the data processed and locked on your devices. Only communication happens if there's devices around you. So, you can choose to go off the grid anytime. As soon as you come back, you can choose to be connected or not. Complete ownership on what you need to know and how. You choose what is important to you and to what context. The dapps run straight from the devices. All it'd need is a simple manifest file for it to render and keep a cache locally sorted by how much data you'd want to store based on what's more used and so on. More about this in a different paper once we're closed to our Stage 2.

The Open Metaverse OS will start as a cloud OS which can run on any device connected to the internet. Our custom DNS switcher can connect to one or more networks as per need. You can also connect to Web2 if in case you need something. We're not cutting off anything. We're building alongside it.
